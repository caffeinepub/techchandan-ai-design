  "summary": "The diff clearly updates the central service pricing data to the new tiered INR strings and changes the Services page heading to \"Our Pricing\" while rendering prices from the updated config. However, the diff does not show any concrete code changes to other pricing surfaces (Order form dropdown and Home page preview), so REQ-31 cannot be verified as implemented from the provided file diffs.",

      "reason": "No actual diffs are shown for OrderForm.tsx or HomePage.tsx, so there is no evidence that their displayed price text was updated to the new INR tiered values.",
